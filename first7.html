<p>Ever since children have learned to read, there has been children’s literature. Children’s Literature charts the makings of the Western literary
imagination from Aesop’s fables to Mother Goose, from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland to Peter Pan, 
from Where the Wild Things Are to Harry Potter.</p>
